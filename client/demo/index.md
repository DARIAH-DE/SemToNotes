_Semantic Topological Notes_ (SemToNotes) is a topological image annotation and image retrieval system written in JavaScript. It allows the analysis of spatio-topological relations between semantically enriched image areas.

SemToNotes is currently developed at the [Institute of Humanities Computer Science](http://hki.uni-koeln.de) at the University of Cologne as part of the [DARIAH-DE Project](https://de.dariah.eu/) (Phase II, March 2014 - February 2016).
