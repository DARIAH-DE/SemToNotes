  <h1>HTML DOM</h1>
  <p>The SVG rendering engine with its DOM representation gives nice insight into the internal mode of operation of a drawing canvas.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The first child element of a drawing canvas is a graphic group <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> representing the <strong>view-box</strong> of a drawing canvas. The view-box group
        has a transformation matrix attached that is used to realize pan-zoom-rotate functionality.</li>
    <li>Inside the view-box group there are four more groups representing different layers: <strong>background-layer</strong>, <strong>shape-layer</strong>, <strong>shape-modify-layer</strong>, and <strong>shape-create-layer</strong>. These four groups
        automatically take part in the matrix transformations of the view-box.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>background-layer</strong> is useful to realize annotation functionality with a drawing canvas. Annotation tools aim to draw shapes not just on a blank paper but in front of an image, for example.</li>
      <li>The <strong>shape-layer</strong> holds all shapes that shall be rendered on the drawing canvas.</li>
      <li>The <strong>shape-modify</strong> layer is a temporary layer for helper shapes. It holds dragging elements, for example, with which one can change the size of a shape or one point of a polygon.</li>
      <li>The <strong>shape-create</strong> layer is a temporary layer for helper shapes as well. It holds the preview of a shape during the drawing process of a shape, for example.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The last layer group is a <strong>tool-layer</strong> reserved for magnifiers, image thumbs and similar things. Remarkably, this layer is not inside the view-box since tools normally shall have a fixed size and position and shall not be affected
        by any matrix transformations of the view-box.</li>
    <li>The last polygon shape is just a 'rectangular shield' introduced for the SVG and VML rendering engine for technical reasons. The drawing canvas ensures that the rectangular shield always sits in front of all other groups and shapes and always has
        the same size as the drawing canvas itself. This shield, therefore, receives all incoming browser events at first (in the case of SVG and VML). All other SVG or VML DOM elements are hidden for browser events. In this way, the SVG and VML drawing canvas
        can make use of the same internal event handling mechanisms as for HTML Canvas rendering. Remember that HTML Canvas by nature has only one DOM element <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> accessible for browser events.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The layer-wise organization is the same for all rendering engines, besides that VML rendering uses different DOM elements and attributes and the Canvas rendering engine
     has only one DOM element <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> but no DOM representation for shapes.</p>
  <p>The layer-wise organization of the drawing canvas is highly inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/SVG-Edit/svgedit">SVG-edit</a> tool.</p>
