  <h1>Modifying Shapes</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>A Shape can be moved as a whole by touching and dragging it.</li>
    <li>When touching a shape, <em>helper shapes</em> appear (small circles) that can be used to change the geometry of a shape. For circle and ellipse shapes,
        the helper shape changes the radius / the radii of the shape. For all other shapes (line, polygon, poly-line, rectangle), the helper shape moves one coordinate point of the shape.</li>
    <li><strong>When modifying a shape, the drawing canvas recalculates all coordinate points and the sizes of a shape. Remarkably, the drawing
        canvas does not realize modification of shapes with an additional transformation matrix (scale, translation) applied to the original coordinates.
        This is by design and is an accommodation for the easy implementation of annotation tools (interested in the native coordinates and sizes at any time).</strong></li>
